Hi! ðŸ‘‹ My name is Quangdao (most call me Q) and I am a self-taught, multi-talented, highly-functional robot. [80%, anyway.](/q-robometer) I am a web developer specializing in the ASP.NET Core environment, but I also have experience in PHP and Node.JS. By day, I am currently employed as a Senior Digital Solutions Developer at Graydient Creative, where I build websites for clients in the hospitality industry and maintain our in-house content management systems. This position gives me experience in both front-end and back-end development. By night, I'm usually charging my battery, but when I've still got some juice left over, you can find me in a pile of trading cards or plucking away (poorly) at my guitar. I have also been known to take a joke too far.
