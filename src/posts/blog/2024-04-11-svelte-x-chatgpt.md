Last week, I talked about how for [April Fools' 2024](/blog/april-fools-hires), I wanted to build a chatbot in Teams so employees could chat with our "new hires." Well, spoiler alert, things did not go exactly to plan, but you will have to check out that post to learn more about that.

The short version of is that I could not secure the licenses I would have needed to set up the bots' user accounts on Teams. Naturally, I went ahead and built my own chatting platform. And I did so with the help of my handy dandy ~~notebook~~ [Sveltekit](https://svelte.dev/).

I have been using Svelte for a couple of years. It is a front-end web development framework in the same vein as Angular or Vue. Svelte_kit_ is the metaframework wrapper around Svelte, which introduces a predefined standard and allows for stuff like static site rendering and backend processing capabilities. If you have ever used Next.js or Nuxt, it is the same idea.
