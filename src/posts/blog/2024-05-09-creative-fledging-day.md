Yeah, I know, I know. My next post was supposed to be about hooking up to ChatGPT in Sveltekit. Look, [I’ve been busy](https://www.instagram.com/qorndog_draws/), okay?

April 8th was Draw a Bird Day. I’ve wanted to learn how to draw for a while, so I thought it would be fun to give this a shot. After all, the holiday itself, according to [National Today](https://nationaltoday.com/draw-a-bird-day/), is all about having fun and sharing drawings of birds, regardless of artistic talent. So I drew this:

And this:

  I hate having ideas and not being able to materialize them.

The next day happened to be National Unicorn Day, and I thought that would be another interesting subject to try to draw. And that gave me an idea:

![maybe I should do a series of daily drawings based on the current holiday. Could serve as a motivation and an inspiration.](/images/blog/discord-holiday-drawings.png)

So on April 9th, I started a new challenge for myself. To draw something every day based off a current holiday. And I did. Every day. For a whole month. Well [kind of](https://www.instagram.com/p/C6JLiVThxm2/).

And to commemorate this accomplishment, I am declaring that May 9th, one month after I officially started this silly challenge, to be Creative Fledging Day. Obviously, this holiday is not officially recognized in any capacity, but you are all welcome to celebrate with me.

Creative Fledging Day celebrates artistic exploration. It honors the drive to learn something new, try different artistic endeavors, or pursue that one project that you've kept pushing off. Similar to Draw a Bird Day, Creative Fledging Day isn't about talent. I certainly didn't become an expert illustrator in just a month. It's about exploring your potential and pushing yourself. And most importantly, it's about realizing that you're capable of far more than what you would believe if you simply just try.
