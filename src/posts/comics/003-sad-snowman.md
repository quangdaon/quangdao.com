_A snowman is seen on a sunny day, smiling with its arms held up._

_The snowman begins to melt, but maintains most of its structure. Its nose, arms, and smile are starting to droop._

_The snowman has now melted to the point where its arms and carrot nose have fallen off the main structure._

_Close-up of the snowman's face show that the smile has drooped to form what appears to be a frown and the melted water droplets resemble tears around its eyes._
