_A boy is seen from behind, sharpening a pencil using an electric pencil sharpener._

_The boy removes the pencil and looks at it._

_Angle shifts to show the boy from the front, hold the pencil to his face._

_The boy puts his hand with the pencil down, only the boy is visible with a neutral expression._

_The boy's expression changes to a wide smile._

_Shot zooms into the boy's waste, showing him starting to unzip his pants._

_Zoom out to show a full view of Earth._

**Boy (Presumably):** AHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!

_Zoom back in to reveal a man now carrying the boy, whose pants has dropped around his ankles. His "private regions" have been covered with a black box labeled "\*censored\*". Above the pencil sharpener, there is a spider hanging from a web that starts above the frame._

_In a close-up of the sharpener, the spider is now seen crawling on top of it with a very subtle smile._
