_A boy is talking on a cell phone to his dad on a landline._

**Boy:** Hey dad! Tonight, I'm getting drunk--  
**Dad:** WHAT?! No! You are only 16 years old!  
**Boy:** But... I'm only getting drunk--  
**Dad:** I said no, and that's final!  
**Boy:** Listen old man! I am getting drunk--  
**Dad:** Fine! Just don't think of me as your father anymore!  
**Boy:** YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND I'M--  
**Dad:** You know what? Just do whatever the hell you want!  
**Boy:** But I'm just getting drunk...  

_Dad slams the phone onto its stand, and it shakes as he walks away angrily._

**Boy:** ...people arrested.

_Zoom out to reveal the boy hiding behind a bush across from a street of houses. The third house from the left has a party going on. "\*Beep\* \*Boop\* \*Boop\*" is visible near the boy indicating that he's dialing 911._
