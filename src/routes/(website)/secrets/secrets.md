Congratulations, you found the hidden page! Here is a (allegedly) comprehensive list of all the little secrets Iâ€™ve hidden throughout this website.

- This page! If you're reading this, I assume you already know how to get here. Or maybe you're reading this out of my source code or found some other ways to cheat. In any case, here are the proper steps:
  1. On my home screen, there is a mysterious key hole that, when clicked, pops up a dialog to build a key.
  2. If you build the key correctly, you will be redirected to this hidden page, where I unveil all of my deepest, darkest secrets.
  3. The correct combination can be found on my error page. If you manage to navigate to an incorrect URL, you be greeted with a generic-looking 404 / "Page Not Found" message.
  4. Drag the title over to the right, and you will find the key.
  5. Don't bother with memorizing it or writing it down, the key rotates daily.
- On my homepage, you can hover over the waving hand to make it wave.
  - If you happen to cacth me playing music on Spotify, the hand turns into animated notes, and if you hover over them, you can see what song I'm listening to.
- My footer shows my name, along with a phonetic pronunciation guide. If you double-click on it, it transforms into the Vietnamese spelling, as well as my poor attempt at transcribing the proper Vietnamese pronunciation.
- You might have already noticed the gears hanging around the bottom-right ([shoutout to Abel Vincze!](https://geargenerator.com/beta/)), but did you notice that each rotation of the large gear corresponds to exactly one page of scrolling?
