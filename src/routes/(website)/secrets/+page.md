Congratulations, you found the hidden page! Here is a (allegedly) comprehensive list of all the little secrets Iâ€™ve hidden throughout this website.

- This Page! Right now, I can only assume you found this by browsing the source code repository or just happened upon it randomly as I haven't added a method of getting here yet.
- My footer shows my name, along with a phonetic pronunciation guide. If you double-click on it, it transforms into the Vietnamese spelling, as well as my poor attempt at transcribing the proper Vietnamese pronunciation.
- You might have already noticed the gears hanging around the bottom-right ([shoutout to Abel Vincze!](https://geargenerator.com/beta/)), but did you notice that each rotation of the large gear corresponds to exactly one page of scrolling?
